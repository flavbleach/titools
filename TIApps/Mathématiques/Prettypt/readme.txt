PRETTYPT (PrettyPrint) is a powerful tool visualize and edit complex 
mathematical expressions. It provides useful features like answer-varible 
import and cut / paste functionality. The application was designed for 
co-operation with SYMBOLIC by Brandon Sterner - THANKS TO HIM.

(visit http://www.detacheds.com/symbolic/)

SYMPOLIC provides a function named pretty( to co-operate with PRETTYPT
in the following way:

pretty(0)	

	- returns current PRETTYPT version

pretty(expr)
	
	- prints an expression to the graph screen, which is passed as string

pretty(expr, top, height)

	- prints an expression to the graph screen, which is passed as string
	- top (real value) must contain the top line of the output window and
	  height (real value) must containt the height of the output window
